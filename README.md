## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
The Web-based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software will simulate real-life interview scenarios. It allows experts (interviewers) to assess applicants through a structured set of questions and evaluate their answers in a systematic, unbiased, and data-driven way. The system will:

Allow interviewers to define a list of questions based on specific skills/competencies required for a position. Use AI/ML algorithms to match the relevancy of questions with the applicantâ€™s profile (skills, expertise). Provide scoring metrics for both the questions and answers based on predefined relevancy and quality criteria. Generate a final score for the candidate, which helps in evaluating their suitability for the advertised post.
